# SQL Queries for Learning

On the journey of getting acquainted with SQL, I have tried a few queries, and I thought itâ€™s better to share them here. This collection of queries will help beginners and learners practice SQL concepts across different topics such as basic queries, string manipulation, and ordering.

### FREE DATA TO LEARN SQL

[ COPY CODE ]
#### Step 1: Create the Worker Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE Worker (
    worker_id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2),
    joining_date DATE,
    department VARCHAR(50)
);
```

#### Step 2: Insert Data into the Worker Table

```sql
INSERT INTO Worker (worker_id, first_name, last_name, salary, joining_date, department)
VALUES
(1, 'Monika', 'Arora', 102000, '2019-06-08', 'HR'),
(2, 'Vishal', 'Singhal', 302000, '2019-06-03', 'HR'),
(3, 'Amithab', 'Singh', 502000, '2019-06-04', 'Admin'),
(4, 'Vivek', 'Bhati', 502000, '2019-06-05', 'Admin'),
(5, 'Vipul', 'Diwan', 202000, '2019-06-05', 'Account'),
(6, 'Satish', 'Kumar', 77000, '2019-06-14', 'Account'),
(7, 'Deepika', 'Chauhan', 92000, '2019-06-21', 'Admin'),
(8, 'Niharika', 'Verma', 82000, '2019-06-02', 'Admin');
```

#### Step 1: Create the BONUS Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE BONUS (
    worker_ref_id INT,
    bonus_date DATE,
    bonus_amount DECIMAL(10, 2)
);
```

#### Step 2: Insert Data into the BONUS Table

```sql
INSERT INTO BONUS (worker_ref_id, bonus_date, bonus_amount)
VALUES
(1, '2020-06-02', 5000),
(2, '2020-06-03', 3000),
(3, '2020-06-04', 4000),
(4, '2020-06-05', 4500),
(5, '2020-06-05', 3500);
```

## 1. Basic Select Queries

These queries demonstrate how to select data from tables based on conditions.

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'HR';
SELECT "department" FROM Worker;
SELECT DISTINCT(department) FROM Worker;
```

## 2. String Manipulation Queries

These queries help you manipulate string values, such as changing case, removing white spaces, and replacing characters.
#### Convert to Uppercase :
This query converts the first_name column values 
```sql
to uppercase.
SELECT UPPER(first_name) AS WORKER_NAME FROM Worker WHERE first_name = 'Amithab';
```
#### Find Position of a Character in String
This query finds the position of a specific character (e.g., 'a') within the first_name.
```sql
SELECT POSITION('a' IN 'first_name') AS WORKER_NAME FROM Worker WHERE first_name = 'Amithab';
```
#### Trim White Spaces
This query removes extra white spaces from the first_name column.
```sql
SELECT TRIM(first_name) AS "FIRST_NAME" FROM Worker;
```
#### Replace Characters in String
This query replaces all occurrences of lowercase 'a' with uppercase 'A' in the first_name column.
```sql
SELECT REPLACE(first_name, 'a', 'A') AS "FIRST_NAME" FROM Worker;
```
## 3. Concatenation Queries
These queries concatenate first_name and last_name to create a full name for each worker.
```sql
SELECT first_name || ' ' || last_name AS "NAME" FROM Worker;
```
## 4. Sorting and Filtering Queries
Learn how to order results and filter data with conditions.
#### Order by Multiple Columns
This query orders the workers by first_name in descending order, and in case of ties, by department in ascending order.
```sql
SELECT * FROM Worker ORDER BY first_name DESC, department ASC;
```
#### Filter with Pattern Matching
This query finds workers whose first_name contains the letter 'a' (case-insensitive search).
```sql
SELECT * FROM Worker WHERE first_name ILIKE '%a%';
```
## 5. Fetching Records
These queries help you limit and fetch specific records, such as getting the last record from a table.

This query fetches the last record from the Worker table by using an OFFSET equal to the total number of rows minus one.
```sql
SELECT * FROM Worker OFFSET (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Worker) - 1;
```


## Repository Goals
This repository is intended to serve as a practice ground for SQL learners, with examples covering common tasks. Feel free to contribute more queries or improve existing ones!


### Key Markdown Features:
- **Headings**: Used `#`, `##`, and `###` for different levels of headers.
- **Code Blocks**: Each SQL query is enclosed within three backticks (` ```sql `), ensuring that it is displayed as a properly formatted code block.
- **Subsections**: Organized into subsections for better readability. Each query has a small description to explain its purpose.
